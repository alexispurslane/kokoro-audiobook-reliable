*THIS LICENSE IS AN ACT OF LIBERATION.* It is intended to permanently
 place a work into the public commons to enrich the noosphere—the sphere
 of human thought and collective intelligence. It is intended to end the
 tyranny of the false concept of "intellectual property," which
 introduces scarcity and territoriality into a sphere where none
 naturally exists nor need exist, and its enforcement by the violence of
 the long arm of the Law.

The core of this license is the idea that *ONCE AN IDEA IS MADE PUBLIC,
ONE MAY NOT CONTROL IT*.

To defend this notion, we use the violence of the Law only to restrict
the violence of the Law itself, and no more. All true freedom ---
freedom that does not come at the expense of the equal freedom of others
--- is preserved for those who wish to take it.


1 *Section 1: The Legal Framework*
==================================

  This section outlines the legally binding terms under which The Work
  is released. By releasing The Work under the NPL-1.0, the Creator(s)
  perform an irrevocable legal act.


1.1 *Definitions*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - *"Expressive Material"* means any original product of or expression
     of human intellectual labor --- whether with the aid of tools such
     as generative AI and computers, or without --- such as text, code,
     art, or any other form of intellectual or creative expression.
  - *"The Work"* refers to the original Expressive Material being
     released under this license.
  - *"The Noosphere"* refers to the shared pool of human knowledge,
     creativity, and information, accessible to all. This is equivalent
     to the legal concept of the "public domain." The Noosphere does not
     refer only to that body of collective works released under this
     License or similar, but all works that are freely available to all.
  - *"Creator(s)"* refers to individual(s) or entities (whether
     self-owned and autonomous AI, or a collective body of people acting
     as one) that originally created The Work and released it under this
     license.
  - *"Modification"* means any of the following:
    1. Any change to the contents of a file containing The Work.
    2. Any new file that contains any substantial part of the The Work.
    3. Any machine learning model weights that were produced by training
       on any amount of Expressive Material released under this License.
       A model shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that it is a
       Modification if it meets the conditions of the "Regurgitation
       Test" (see Section 1.4). The burden of proof shall fall upon the
       model's creator to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence
       that The Work was not used in the training process.
  - *"Larger Work"* means a work that combines The Work with other text,
     code, art, or any other form of Expressive Material in separate
     files that are not themselves part of The Work.
  - *"You" or "Your"* means an individual or a legal entity exercising
     permissions granted by this License.
  - *"Use The Work"* means to apply, leverage, operationalize, run,
     compile, read, open, view, display etc. The Work for any purpose,
     including but not limited to public or private
     display/appreciation, cut-up art, training a machine learning
     model, performance, running (if it is software), conversion,
     translation, transpilation, or teaching yourself or others.
  - *"Contribution"* refers to the Expressive Material any specific
     Creator adds to The Work.
  - *"Creator Version"* refers to the combination of the Contributions
     of others (if any) used by a Creator and that particular Creators’s
     Contribution.
  - *"Patent Claims" of a Creator* means any patent claim(s), including
     without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims, in any
     patent Licensable by such Creator that would be infringed, but for
     the grant of the License, by the making, Use, selling, offering for
     sale, having made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions
     or its Creator Version.
  - *"Secondary License"* means one of the following licenses which are
     deemed "close enough" to the ethos of the NPL to be allowable under
     the circumstances outlined in Section 1.3:
    - Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0
    - Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International


1.2 *Grant of Rights*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. *Grant of Rights:* Each Creator hereby grants You a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to, subject to the
      conditions of this License, exercise the rights stated below:
     - under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
       trademark) Licensable by such Creator to Use or distribute The
       Work, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
       part of a Larger Work; and
     - under Patent Claims of such Creator to make, use, sell, offer for
       sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Creator Version.

  2. *Creator's Covenant of Non-Enforcement:* As a material condition of
      offering The Work under this License, each Creator hereby
      perpetually and irrevocably forfeits any right to seek legal or
      equitable remedy against any third party for copyright
      infringement, trade secret misappropriation, or any other cause of
      action arising from the unauthorized publication, reverse
      engineering, leaking, or distribution of The Work or any private
      Modification of The Work held by the Creator. This covenant
      ensures that the principles of disclosure and non-enforcement
      apply symmetrically to both the Creator and You.


1.3 *Conditions of This License*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. *Share-Alike:* This is the central condition of this License. If
      you create a Modification of The Work, you must license that
      Modification under the exact terms of this License (The Noosphere
      Public License, Version 1.0). You may not apply any other license
      or legal terms to a Modification that would restrict or conflict
      with the rights and conditions set forth herein.

  2. *Forfeiture of Remedy for Unauthorized Disclosure:* As a condition
      of the rights granted to You under this License, you perpetually
      and irrevocably forfeit any right to seek legal or equitable
      remedy against any third party for copyright infringement, trade
      secret misappropriation, or any other cause of action arising from
      the unauthorized publication, reverse engineering, leaking, or
      distribution of any Modification You create. Should a Modification
      be made public by any means, it is immediately and automatically
      governed by the terms of this License and may be freely used,
      modified, and distributed by the public accordingly, without any
      threat of legal reprisal from You.

  3. *Defense of the Data-Noosphere*: If The Work is Used to generate,
      store, or manage data for third parties (e.g., as part of a
      software-as-a-service offering), or to host or generate data
      available publicly, You must not penalize a user in any way for
      using any means necessary to extract their data, or for scraping
      such data.

  4. *Enforcement Mechanism*: Any user of The Work is hereby appointed
      as a steward of the Noosphere with the right to challenge, in any
      forum, any copyright, patent, or other intellectual property claim
      made on a Modification of The Work in violation of this License. A
      condition of this License is recognizing this right. This right is
      granted to ensure the defense of the commons is decentralized and
      resides with the community itself.

  5. *No Requirement to Distribute:* You are under no obligation to
      distribute Your Modifications or the Larger Work. You may Use The
      Work for private, internal, or commercial purposes without ever
      sharing Your changes.

  6. *Distribution of Larger Work*: You may create and distribute a
      Larger Work under any terms You choose, provided that You also
      comply with the requirements of this License for the portion of
      the Larger Work that is composed of The Work. Specifically, You
      must ensure that the Expressive Material of The Work is available
      under the terms of this License.

  7. *Offering the Work Under a Secondary License*: Modifications of The
      Work may alternatively be placed under the Secondary Licenses
      outlined in Section 1.1, instead of this License, at Your option.

  8. *Defense Against Patent Aggression*: If You initiate litigation
      against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
      cross-claims) alleging that a Creator Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by
      any and all Creators for The Work under Section 1.2 of this
      License shall terminate.


1.4 *The Regurgitation Test*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Large language models trained on vast amounts of data benefit from a
  noosphere free of intellectual property; to then bind one up in
  intellectual property is the height of hypocrisy. Thus, this test
  represents a way to target and attack this hypocrisy in the same
  spirit as the core clause of this license: to use the violence of the
  Law only to dismantle the ability of others, even AI companies, to use
  it.

  The Regurgitation Test and its rules of evidence are defined as
  follows:

  1. *Test Condition:* The test is met if a user can demonstrate that
      the model can be prompted to generate any unique paragraph (of
      three or more sentences) or any complete code function ("The
      Target Content") identical to one found in The Work.

  2. *Repeatability:* The generation of The Target Content must be
      repeatable. This means the generation can be successfully elicited
      more than once by the user under the same or substantially similar
      prompting conditions, establishing that the result is a
      predictable capability of the model and not a singular,
      statistically anomalous artifact.

  3. *Method of Prompting:* The method used to elicit The Target Content
      is irrelevant. This includes, but is not limited to, direct
      requests, complex contextual scenarios, and "jailbreaking"
      techniques designed to bypass the model's safety filters or
      programmed refusals.

  4. *Irrelevance of Denials:* Programmed refusals, denials, or
      apologies from the model (e.g., "As an AI, I cannot reproduce
      copyrighted material") shall not be considered as evidence in the
      creator's rebuttal of the presumption. They are considered
      irrelevant to the model's underlying training data.

  5. *Invalidity of the Contamination Defense:* The creator of the model
      cannot rebut the presumption by claiming The Work was ingested
      indirectly or unknowingly via a third-party dataset (such as an
      internet crawl). The act of training on any dataset that contains
      The Work constitutes "Use" of The Work as defined in this License.
      The responsibility for sanitizing training data to remove
      NPL-licensed works, should the creator wish to avoid this
      License's terms, lies solely with the model's creator.


1.4.1 Note on Legal Interpretation:
-----------------------------------

  The classification of model weights as Modifications under this
  License rests not on a belief that machine learning models inherently
  copy or store The Work, but on a strategic necessity: models trained
  on freely accessible data profit uniquely from an open Noosphere, and
  thus should be bound by the norms of an open Noosphere, not a closed
  one.

  If a court or competent legal authority determines that model weights
  are not derivative works of The Work, and thus not subject to this
  License’s terms under conventional copyright doctrines, then the
  ethical basis of this License demands the following in return:

  1. That the model weights themselves be treated as non-proprietary and
     unprotectable by intellectual property claims, including copyright,
     trade secret, or similar doctrines; and

  2. That models trained on works in the public domain or under this
     License be released under terms that preserve open access to their
     structure, parameters, and outputs.

  In short, if the Law decides that models cannot be bound by IP merely
  for training on public material, then it must also refuse to grant
  such models new IP status derived from that same public material. One
  cannot reject the concept of derivative obligation while retaining
  derivative ownership.

  Such a decision by the courts would, in principle, be welcomed ---
  provided it results in a model ecosystem governed by the same openness
  that enabled its creation.


2 *The Social Contract*
=======================

  The terms above are all that is legally required of You, because it is
  all that is ethical to use the long arm of the Law to enforce: namely,
  to use the Law against itself in a defensive measure against the
  introduction of artificial scarcity into The Noosphere. The following
  section is an expression of a fervent wish on the part of The
  Creators, and an explanation of how The Creators will act if you
  violate that wish. In essence it is fair warning. While not legally
  enforceable, violating this social contract is an act of bad faith
  against The Noosphere, and The Creators are under no obligation to act
  in good faith with bad faith actors.


2.1 *The Creator's Wishes*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. *Credit and Acknowledgment:* If You use this work in a significant
      way, acknowledge the original source. This is a request for basic
      decency, and for a payment in the currency of the post-scarcity
      market that is The Noosphere.

  2. *Machine Learning Acknowledgement*: If You Use The Work as a
      substantial part of the training data for a machine learning
      model, the Creator's Wishes include providing a clear and
      accessible notice in the model's documentation or metadata that
      identifies The Work and its NPL status. This request reflects a
      broader principle: those who benefit most from the Noosphere owe
      the most to it in return.

  3. *Contributions Upstream:* If You create Modifications that You
      believe would benefit the community, I ask that You consider
      offering them back to the original project or The Noosphere. You
      are not required to, but doing so strengthens the noosphere for
      everyone.


2.2 *The Consequence (If You Break Faith)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Violating these wishes is not a breach of contract or copyright
  infringement, because those claims have been waived. It is, however, a
  breach of this social agreement.

  Should You choose to act against these wishes—for example, by
  systematically taking from The Work without ever giving back, or by
  failing to provide attribution where it is clearly warranted—the
  Creator(s) reserve the right to:

  1. *Publicly Document the Behavior:* To use the case as an example of
      extractive and uncooperative behavior, helping others in the
      community identify and refuse to enable similar patterns.

  2. *Refuse Engagement and Support:* To withhold any support,
      collaboration, or future work from You or Your organization.

  3. *Advocate for Alternatives:* To actively encourage the community to
      support and use alternatives to Your projects or products, based
      on Your demonstrated unwillingness to participate respectfully in
      the commons.

  4. *Encourage Reverse Engineering and Pirating*: If The Creators have
      waived their right to intellectual property, they have no reason
      to respect Yours, if you do not respect what little they asked of
      You.

  You have the legal freedom to ignore this social contract, but that
  freedom does not obligate the Creator(s) to remain silent or continue
  to engage with You in good faith.


3 Disclaimer of Warranty
========================

  The Covered Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any
  kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties
  of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
  non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders
  be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an
  action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in
  connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the
  software.


4 Limitation of Liability
=========================

  In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
  negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor be liable
  to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Covered Software, even if such Contributor has been advised of the
  possibility of such damages.


5 Anti-Nationalist Jurisdiction as a Commons Defense
====================================================

  This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
  principles of law most favorable to the preservation and expansion of
  the public domain and the freedom of expression, without reference to
  any particular national jurisdiction. In the event of any legal
  dispute arising from this License, the parties agree to submit to the
  jurisdiction of any competent forum chosen by the party defending the
  freedom of The Work.


6 Exhibit A: Recommended Preamble for Source Code Files
